Part 1:
    # Contains factorial algorithms using different methods (loops, recursion, memoization, reduce)

Part 2:
      # Contains object oriented programming methods in R programming
           # data small study on indoor air pollution on 10 subjects
           # each subject was visited 3 times
           # pollution level recorded every 5 mins for 1 week

      # variables: 
         # id = subject identification number, 
         # visit = the visit number which can be 0,1,2 
         # room = room in which the monitor was placed, 
         # value = the level of pollution in micrograms per cubic meter, 
         # timepoint = the time point of the monitor value for a given visit/room

      # make_LD: a function that converts a data frame into a "LongitudinalData" object
      # subject: a generic function for extracting subject-specific information
      # visit: a generic function for extracting visit-specific information
      # room: a generic function for extracting room-specific information
